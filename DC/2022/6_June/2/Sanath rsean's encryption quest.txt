Sanath rsean's encryption quest!
  One day sean's friend john wanted him to encrypt a few messages that were to be sent via a telegram group, so that everyone could see the message, but 
only those special people who knew decryption can actually understand it. help sean write a code that take input values of the type of encryption, a key, and a message to be encrypted that had something to do with the key.input format:first line containing the type of encryption x.second line containing the
key k.third line containing the message m.

output format:
the first line contains the encrypted message.

Note:
  The encryption process is based on the simple logic of addition, that is simply adding the value of the key(/modified key) to the characters of the message to be encrypted. only upper case alphabets need to be considered.x is a number -1 or 0 or 1,\
    a) -1 denotes the decreasing value of the key
    b) 0 denotes the constant value of the key
    c) 1 denotes the increasing value of the keyd) in case of invalid input value of x simply display “invalid input”.
 
if the input value of k is less than or equal to 0, make the initial value of k as 1
Boundary conditions:
The maximum length of the message m is 200 and it's minimum length is 1

example input/output 01:
input:
1 
2
summer

output:
uxqrky

explanation: every time the key is used on a character its value is incremented by 1

example input/output 02:
input:
-1

holiday
output:

explanation: every time the key is used on a character its value is decremented by 1
